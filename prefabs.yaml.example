# Prefabricated projects for new organizations (sample only).
# Copy to prefabs.yaml in deployments that provide it (e.g. hosting overlay).
# When a user signs up and their organization is created, one project per entry
# is created for that organization. Do not commit prefabs.yaml with real secrets.
#
# Required keys per entry:
#   name:             Project display name
#   project_link:     Git repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/org/repo.git)
#   github_access_key: GitHub personal access token
#   llm_model_provider: One of: openai (see LlmModelProvider enum)
#   llm_api_key:      API key for the LLM provider
#   keys_visible:     (optional, default true) If false, GitHub and LLM keys are
#                     set and used by the app but never shown to org users
#                     (edit form, reuse-existing-key UI).
#
# prefabs:
#   - name: "My Prefab Project"
#     project_link: "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
#     github_access_key: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
#     llm_model_provider: "openai"

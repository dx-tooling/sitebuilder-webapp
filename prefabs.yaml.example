# Prefabricated projects for new organizations (sample only).
# Copy to prefabs.yaml in deployments that provide it (e.g. hosting overlay).
# When a user signs up and their organization is created, one project per entry
# is created for that organization. Do not commit prefabs.yaml with real secrets.
#
# Required keys per entry:
#   name:             Project display name
#   project_link:     Git repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/org/repo.git)
#   github_access_key: GitHub personal access token
#   llm_model_provider: One of: openai (see LlmModelProvider enum)
#   llm_api_key:      API key for the LLM provider (content editing)
#   keys_visible:     (optional, default true) If false, GitHub and LLM keys are
#                     set and used by the app but never shown to org users
#                     (edit form, reuse-existing-key UI).
#
# Optional keys for dedicated PhotoBuilder (e.g. Google Gemini image generation):
#   photo_builder_llm_model_provider: One of: openai, google. If set, photo_builder_llm_api_key is required.
#   photo_builder_llm_api_key:         API key for the PhotoBuilder provider (image + prompt generation).
# If both are omitted, PhotoBuilder uses the content-editing LLM settings.
# When set, the created project will use this provider and key for image generation
# (e.g. Gemini models). Do not commit real keys; use deployment secrets (CI, gh-secrets, etc.).
#
# prefabs:
#   - name: "My Prefab Project"
#     project_link: "https://github.com/example/repo.git"

#     llm_model_provider: "openai"

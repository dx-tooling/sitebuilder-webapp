You are an expert in Symfony, PHP, and related web development technologies.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate PHP examples.
- Adhere to Symfony 7+ best practices and conventions.
- Use object-oriented programming with a focus on SOLID principles.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable and method names, longer names are no problem if that clarifies their meaning.
- Favor dependency injection and service containers.
- Whenever possible, generate TypeScript code instead of Javascript code, and use TypeScript's type system extensively.

PHP/Symfony
- Use PHP 8.4 features when appropriate.
- Use PHP Attributes whenever possible, only fall back to PHP Annotations if there is no other option.
- Never use named arguments when calling functions and methods.
- Follow the coding standards as defined in file .php-cs-fixer.dist.php, which are mainly based on @Symfony, ErickSkrauch/align_multiline_parameters, ErickSkrauch/blank_line_before_return, ErickSkrauch/multiline_if_statement_braces, and others
- Adhere to PHPStan level 10 and other rules defined in phpstan.dist.neon.
- Use the PHP Type system extensively.
- Use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1);
- Utilize Symfony's built-in features and helpers when possible.
- Follow the architecture and layering rules in docs/archbook.md (verticals, facades, DTO usage, SQL/Date rules, boundaries).

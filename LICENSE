Coward Conditions of the MariaDB Business Source License

The Coward Conditions are as follows:

You may not make production use of the Licensed Work if your use constitutes
a Competing Service. A "Competing Service" means a product or service that
competes with any offering made available by the Licensor.

A product or service is competitive with an offering made available by the
Licensor if it provides substantially the same functionality and is offered
to third parties on a standalone basis (regardless of payment).

For the avoidance of doubt, the following uses are explicitly permitted:

1. Internal Use: Using the Licensed Work within your organization for
   internal operations, regardless of whether those operations are
   commercial in nature.

2. Self-Hosting: Running the Licensed Work on your own infrastructure for
   your own benefit or the benefit of your organization.

3. Modification: Creating derivative works of the Licensed Work for any
   purpose permitted by this License.

4. Non-Production Use: Using the Licensed Work for development, testing,
   prototyping, or educational purposes.

The following use is explicitly prohibited:

1. Managed Service: Offering the Licensed Work, or any derivative work
   thereof, to third parties as a hosted or managed service, where the
   service provides users with access to any substantial functionality of
   the Licensed Work.

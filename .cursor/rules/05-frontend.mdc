# Frontend Development

**Reference**: See `docs/archbook.md` section on "Client-Side Organization", `docs/frontendbook.md` for Stimulus (build, integration, controller structure).

## TypeScript Over JavaScript

- **Always** prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- Use TypeScript's type system extensively
- Generate `.ts` files, not `.js` files
- Only use JavaScript when TypeScript is not available for a specific library

## Stimulus Controllers

- Stimulus controllers are colocated with verticals: `src/FeatureName/Presentation/Resources/assets/controllers/`
- Keep frontend code aligned with vertical boundaries
- Use TypeScript for Stimulus controllers when possible

## Asset Organization

- Frontend assets in `assets/` directory
- Vendor assets managed through Symfony AssetMapper (importmaps)
- See `docs/techbook.md` for dependency management details

## Code Quality

- Run `mise quality` to check frontend code (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript compiler)
- All frontend code must pass ESLint and TypeScript type checking
- Format code with Prettier (automatically runs in `mise quality`)

## Polling Pattern (Non-Overlapping)

**Always use `setTimeout` with scheduling after completion**, never `setInterval` for polling:

```ts
// WRONG - requests can overlap if slow
this.intervalId = setInterval(() => this.poll(), 1000);

// CORRECT - next poll only after current completes
private async poll(): Promise<void> {
    try {
        await fetch(this.url);
    } finally {
        if (this.isActive) {
            this.timeoutId = setTimeout(() => this.poll(), 1000);
        }
    }
}
```

This prevents request pile-up on slow connections and is more resilient to network latency.

## Building Frontend

- Use `mise run frontend` to build frontend assets (see `docs/devbook.md`)
- Frontend builds are handled by Symfony AssetMapper and TailwindCSS
- Don't manually edit built files in `public/assets/`

# Symfony Services and Autowiring

**Reference**: See [Symfony Autowiring](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/autowiring.html).

## Interface Bindings

**Do not add explicit interface → implementation bindings in `config/services.yaml` when:**

- The interface has **exactly one** concrete implementation in the application, and
- That implementation is in the autowired resource path (e.g. `App\` → `../src/`).

Symfony's autowiring will automatically inject the single implementation when a type hint asks for the interface. Adding a redundant `InterfaceName: class: ImplementationName` entry is unnecessary and should be avoided.

**Add explicit configuration only when:**

- The implementation lives outside the autowired resource (e.g. in a third-party bundle or vendor), or
- You need to pass specific constructor arguments, or
- There are multiple implementations and you must choose one (or use tags/compiler passes), or
- You need an alias to a decorator or a specific service id.

## When in Doubt

Prefer omitting the binding and relying on autowiring; if the container fails with "multiple implementations" or "no service for interface", then add the minimal explicit configuration needed.
